## Interesting Topics
-  The git and github fundamentals has clear information on topics like creating repositories, cloning, pulling, pull requests, branches etc. 
- I taught me more on these areas, especially pull requests, an area I have often struggled with. 

## Challenging Areas
- The content on issues and branches is well presented. 
- However, I have learned that these are not areas one can just understand by reading. 
- They require real practice to master. 

## Areas for Improvement
- I would love to know more about the github community. 
- I also read somewhere about github copilot. I would love to know how that's going.
